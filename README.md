# Wallet Piggy Bank

## Description
The Wallet Piggy Bank application is a demo version that allows users to add funds to their wallet and set a date or timer for locking those funds. Once the timer expires or the specified date is reached, users can unlock and withdraw their money, mimicking the functionality of a traditional piggy bank. This application is designed to showcase the core features of a digital wallet in a user-friendly manner.
